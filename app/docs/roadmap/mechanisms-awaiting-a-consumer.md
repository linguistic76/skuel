# Mechanisms Awaiting a Consumer

*Case file for the [deferred-work.md](deferred-work.md) entry of the same name; move to `done/` when nothing in it remains open.*

These are complete, generic mechanisms that are correctly used in exactly one place today. They
are NOT to be extended speculatively — SKUEL's defer-until-consumer rule means infrastructure does
not get built ahead of a reader. The trigger is a product need, not a data threshold.

## 6. `filter_property` edge-filtering beyond GOALS essentiality

**Why deferred**: PR #216 made the `filter_property`/`filter_value` mechanism on a
`UnifiedRelationshipDefinition` work end-to-end — WRITE auto-stamps the edge property
(`_orient_edge`), and all three read paths auto-filter (`get_related_uids`/`count_related`,
`get_cross_domain_context` categorization, `get_with_context`). It lets one relationship type fan
out into separate typed tier buckets (e.g. a goal's `essential_habits` / `critical_habits` /
`optional_habits` off `(:Habit)-[:SUPPORTS_GOAL {essentiality}]->(:Goal)`). An audit (2026-06-04)
asked whether any *other* domain should use it. **Conclusion: none currently qualifies, so nothing
was shipped — a generic mechanism does not mean it must be used.**

A relationship qualifies only when **all four** links are live at once:

1. **Categorical edge property** — mutually-exclusive exact-match tier values, not a continuous
   number (`strength`, `confidence`) and not a single constant.
2. **Writer stamps varied values** — and is actually *called* with more than the default.
3. **Live data carries it** — real edges have the property set to differing values.
4. **A consumer partitions on it** — some service/UI/intelligence reads the *separate* buckets
   (not just their union) and does something different per tier.

Audit evidence (live Docker Neo4j, full-graph scan):

| Candidate prop | Relationship | Writer | Consumer | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `dependency_type` | `DEPENDS_ON` | `create_task_dependency` stamps single default `"blocks"` | none | reject — single value, uncalled in prod, no live edge carries it |
| `contribution_type` | — | none (renamed → `essentiality` in #216) | n/a | reject — dead |
| `support_type` | — | none (TypedDict-only) | n/a | reject — dead |
| `strength` | edges | continuous confidence proxy only | n/a | reject — numeric threshold, not categorical |

A direct probe returned **zero edges** across the whole graph:

```cypher
MATCH ()-[r]->()
WHERE r.essentiality IS NOT NULL
   OR r.dependency_type IS NOT NULL
   OR r.contribution_type IS NOT NULL
   OR r.support_type IS NOT NULL
RETURN type(r), r.essentiality, r.dependency_type, r.contribution_type, r.support_type, count(*)
```

Even GOALS essentiality — the sole consumer — has no live data yet (the 8 live `SUPPORTS_GOAL`
edges are property-less; the ingestion path doesn't stamp `essentiality`, only the
`link_goal_to_habit` create path does).

**The problem**: The missing ingredient is never the mechanism — it is a consumer with a reason to
distinguish tiers. Until a product question needs, say, *blocking* vs *informational* task
dependencies shown separately, or *critical* supporting habits weighted higher in ZPD, the buckets
are infrastructure no one reads.

**What to do** (when a consumer emerges — `DEPENDS_ON` is the nearest miss, already 1.5 links in):

1. Pin down the product need that wants the tiers treated *differently* (link 4's reason to exist).
2. Make the edge property categorical and teach the writer's callers to stamp the varied values
   (`create_task_dependency` today only ever passes `"blocks"`); backfill existing edges so live
   data carries it.
3. Add catch-all + per-value filtered `UnifiedRelationshipDefinition` mappings (mirror
   GOALS `essential_habits` etc.). The three read paths then auto-filter — no read-side code change.
4. Add a real-Neo4j round-trip test across all three read paths + write-stamp + catch-all control
   (mirror `tests/integration/test_goal_habit_essentiality.py`).

**Enable when**: A consumer needs a non-GOALS relationship's edges partitioned into separate typed
tier buckets (and does something different per tier).

## 7. Knowledge cross-domain context: surface Ku↔Ku `PREREQUISITE_FOR` ("Option B")

**Why deferred**: The Ku cross-domain context anchors to `KU_CONFIG`. PR #215 realigned it to the
one bucket that can populate today — `path_step_uids` (`used_by_steps ∪ trained_by_steps`) — and
dropped four candidate fields. Two of those (`applying_task_uids`, `supported_goal_uids`) are
genuinely sourceless: a live-graph probe found **zero Ku→Activity edges** (every `APPLIES_KNOWLEDGE`
/ `REQUIRES_KNOWLEDGE` / `REINFORCES_KNOWLEDGE` / `INFORMED_BY_KNOWLEDGE` edge targets a `:PathStep`,
never a `:Ku` — application and goal-support live at the PathStep layer). The other two
(`prerequisite_knowledge`, `dependent_knowledge`) are real-but-unsurfaced: live Ku↔Ku
`PREREQUISITE_FOR` edges exist (3 in the graph, oriented `(prereq)-[:PREREQUISITE_FOR]->(dependent)`)
but `KU_CONFIG.cross_domain_relationship_types` only traverses `{USES_KU, TRAINS_KU}`, so they never
reach the context. **"Option B" = add the `PREREQUISITE_FOR` mappings.** It was rejected for #215 to
keep scope to keys-only and to avoid a side effect: `KU_CONFIG.cross_domain_relationship_types` also
feeds Ku-search graph-enrichment, so widening it changes more than this one context.

**The problem**: Nothing yet asks "what are this Ku's prerequisite / dependent Kus?" as separate
buckets. Knowledge has no path-aware `*CrossContext` analyzer wired (the 6 activity domains do;
Ku does not), so building Option B now adds fields no consumer reads, for zero functional gain.

**What to do** (when a consumer wants prerequisite/dependent Kus surfaced):

1. Add `PREREQUISITE_FOR` (both directions) to `KU_CONFIG.cross_domain_relationship_types` —
   incoming → `prerequisite_knowledge` (the prereqs of this Ku), outgoing → `dependent_knowledge`
   (the Kus that depend on this one), per the `(prereq)-[:PREREQUISITE_FOR]->(dependent)` orientation.
2. Surface the new buckets through the canonical path-aware reader (a Ku `*CrossContext` +
   `from_categorized` seam in `core/models/graph/path_aware_types.py`, fed by
   `get_cross_domain_context_typed`).
3. Audit the Ku-search graph-enrichment path for the widened `cross_domain_relationship_types` —
   confirm surfacing prerequisite edges in search results is intended, not an accidental side effect.
4. Add a real-Neo4j round-trip + negative control (seed `PREREQUISITE_FOR`, assert both buckets
   populate with correct orientation — verify on local Docker Neo4j).

**Enable when**: A consumer reads a Ku's prerequisite/dependent Kus as *separate* buckets.

## 8. Task cross-domain context: restore `dependent_task_uids` via incoming-`DEPENDS_ON`

**Why deferred**: PR #215 dropped `dependent_task_uids` from the task cross-domain context because
its only candidate source bucket — `dependents`, fed by `BLOCKED_BY`-incoming — is structurally dead.
The canonical writer `create_task_dependency` (`tasks_service.py`) writes
`(dependent)-[:DEPENDS_ON]->(blocks)`; the live graph has `DEPENDS_ON` task edges and **zero
`BLOCKED_BY`** edges. A task's real dependents are its *incoming* `DEPENDS_ON` edges, and no
`TASKS_CONFIG` bucket surfaces those today.

**The problem**: Nothing yet asks "which tasks depend on this one?" as a separate bucket. The
task cross-domain context is same-domain-scoped to knowledge + goals (task→task dependencies live in
the lateral-relationships system, not here), so the inverse dependency direction has no consumer.

**What to do** (when a consumer wants a task's dependents):

1. Add an incoming-`DEPENDS_ON` mapping to `TASKS_CONFIG.cross_domain_relationship_types` → a
   `dependents` (or `dependent_tasks`) bucket.
2. Surface it through the canonical path-aware reader (extend the path-aware `TaskCrossContext` +
   `from_categorized` seam in `core/models/graph/path_aware_types.py`), plus the matching
   `dependent_count` metric in `calculate_task_cross_domain_metrics`.

**Enable when**: A consumer reads a task's dependents (incoming `DEPENDS_ON`) as a *separate* bucket.
